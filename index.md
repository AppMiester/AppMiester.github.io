# Welcome to my page

## Thanks for stopping by

 ### At the bottom of this page I have a link to the source code for the fishing text adventure game I built for my kids as a project. The game is simple but it has some logic built into it. I created three pond enviroments John's pond, Assawampsett Pond, and Van's Abyss. Each pond you catch a different type of fish (represented with ASCII symbol images). When you start traveling from pond to pond it takes time because you are "walking". Once you catch 3 fish you are awarded a boat and you will be able to travel much faster. If you go to Van's Abyss with a boat, after a few casts, you will be asked a programmer quiz question, and if answered wrong your boat will disenegrate and your cat will be lost.
