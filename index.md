## Thanks for stopping by

 
 
 
   
   
   At the bottom of this page I have a link to the source code for the fishing text adventure game I built for my kids as a project. The game is simple but has some logic built into it. I created three pond enviroments: John's pond, Assawampsett Pond, and Van's Abyss. Each pond you catch different types of fish (represented with ASCII symbol images). At first when you travel from pond to pond it takes time because you are "walking". Once you catch 3 fish you are awarded a boat and you will be able to travel much faster. If you go to Van's Abyss with a boat, after a few casts you will be asked a programmer quiz question, and if answered wrong your boat will disenegrate and all of your fish will be lost.
